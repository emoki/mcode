DAS MCode Change Log

- MCode v5.11.1 -
Updated Pctel format to include larger header.

- MCode v5.10.1 -
Added support for Pctel csv files. 
Specific format must be "Time,Longitude,Latitude,CW Channel,CW RSSI (dB)" and the filename must match the waypoint base filename + '.pctel.csv'.
Time being a the following timestamp format: 2023-10-10T02:24:35.895. 
Allows for Pctel low/high band hardcoding and time offset for matching pctel measurements to waypoints. If time offset is 0 the start of the pctel file was assumed to be the same time as the first waypoint.

- MCode v5.9.2 -
Temporary build that incorporates pixel x and pixel y output for DAS measurements.

- MCode v5.9.1 -
Added toggle to reformat and output all measurements regardless of GPS Lock.
Added GPS lock to reformatted output.
Added RSSI, RSRQ, RSRP, SyncSL, and SyncQuality to the reformatted LTE output.
Reformatted output is given a height of 0 because the height is only within the waypoint files, which are not used when reformatting.

- MCode v5.8.0 -
Any fatal errors (no measurements, additional scanner IDs, etc) that occur during interpolation or when reformatting the data are logged before continuing with the rest of the files.

- MCode v5.7.0 -
Heights are rounded to nearest tenth.

- MCode v5.6.1 -
Bug fix: Files were not reformatted properly due to extension mismatch.

- MCode v5.6.0 -
Optimized DAS EcIo correction algorithm.
Added additional logging.
Corrupt data is processed as much as possible.  Corrupt files are logged.
Additional ARFCN field in RedEye analysis export format.
Scanner IDs of 0 are allowed.  This can happen when dropping a waypoint after the scanner is disconnected from Columbus.

- MCode v5.5.2 -
Bug fix:  DAS measurements were not binned by collection round correctly.
Bug fix:  DAS measurements with low EcIo within collection round pair were not removed correctly.

- MCode v5.5.0 -
Bug fix:  The GPS lock status of a wcdma measurement was not read in correctly.  This would affect the reformatting of wcmda measurements.
When reading in text files we only validate to make sure there are the minimum number of columns needed, i.e. additional columns are allowed.

- MCode v5.4.0 -
Added correction for fluctuations in DAS EcIo caused by gain algorithm.

- MCode v5.3.0 -
Changed output to match Redeye analysis import format.

- MCode v5.0.0 -
Major code overhaul.
Support for macro data.
Interpolation and reformatting measurements have been separated out into separate windows.

- MCode v4.3.1 - 
Remove any out of date measurements that appear at the beginning of a collection file.  This can occur due to a bug in Columbus (DAS Control).  If more than three collection rounds are found out of date an error is thrown and processing is stopped. 

- MCode v4.2.1 - 
To account for SL differences between the WIND3G calculated gain value and the constant high gain value we adjust the interpolated lat/lons so that each pair of constant/calculated gains are given the same lat/lon. 

- MCode v4.1.2 - 
Bug fix: Nanoseconds is now included in the header of the aggregate file.

- MCode v4.1.1 - 
Support for a new format with encrypted signal levels - both input and output.  
The application's title will say "Encryption Bypassed" if it's configured to bypass encryption when outputting data.
Fleshed out help dialog box.
Changed "Interpolated into one file" button so that it reads "Aggregate".
Visual feedback in the output window for files that are not interpolated, i.e. we are reformatting the data and using GPS coordinates directly.
Added additional feedback after processing finishes - specifies which options were checked. 
Added support to install .Net 4.5 if the computer does not have it installed already.
